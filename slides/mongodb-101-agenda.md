##  MongoDB 101 Agenda

* NoSQL and MongoDB
* MongoDB Features
* JSON
* CRUD with the Mongo Shell

note:
    * Topic of NoSQL deserves its own presentation
    * MongoDB features that I won't be covering in depth
    * JSON tutorial
    * Most time will be spent creating, reading, updating, deleting documents.
